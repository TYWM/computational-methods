This repository contains a collection of solvers. Each solver comes with a sample data set, along with the output that would be generated for that data set in the form of a .txt file, a .xlsx spreadsheet, and a .png of the 3D graphed result.

Each solver reads from a "data.txt" file when run, and outputs to the console and to a "output.txt" file.
